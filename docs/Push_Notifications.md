## 🛠️ Technical Steps to Enable Push Notifications

### Step 1: 🚀 Integrate the MiniKit SDK
- Make sure the MiniKit SDK is integrated into your fitness mini-app for seamless interaction with the World ecosystem.

### Step 2: 📤 Use the `sendNotifications` Command

    "workoutId": "workout789",
    "timestamp": "2025-01-22T10:00:00Z"
  }
}
```
